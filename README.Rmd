## Package description

This package has a few miscellaneous functions useful to me, and which might be useful to others. It will be added to over time, and likely will have functions from all over the place as far as utility is concerned.  Nothing extraordinarily unique is here at present, more or less tweaks/variations of available R functions that do almost what I want, but not quite.  Also, I wanted to learn more about building packages, and this was my first foray into that world.  The package itself is not on CRAN but would pass CRAN checks.  Feel free to note issues if you use it.

It is currently undergoing quite a bit of change and many functions are deprecated, as they have been moved to [tidyext](https://github.com/m-clark/tidyext) and [visibly](https://github.com/m-clark/visibly).  This package will be more of a grab-bag of odds and ends that don't seem to fit elsewhere.

I was listening to [Lazerhawk](http://lazerhawk.bandcamp.com/album/redline) at one point while creating it, hence the name, and which I can suggest is decent to listen to for programming, but to each their own in that regard.

## Installation

The usual GitHub installation. **devtools** package required.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('m-clark/lazerhawk')
```

## Functions

### brmsSummaryTable
A function I use when creating reports for other people that involve models using the [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) package.

### colorgorical
An interface for creating palettes from [colorgorical](http://vrl.cs.brown.edu/color/).

### create_adjacency, create_edges
Create an adjacency matrix, or use one to create an edge list.

### create_corr
A function to create a correlation matrix. Useful, for example, in setting up simulations.

### create_palette
Create a palette including complementary, triadic, tetradic, etc. colors.

### extract_nlme_variances
A very specific function for extracting heterogenous variances from nlme output.

### lower_tri, upper_tri
Return a triangular matrix, with some options on what specifically is returned.

### pairwise
Apply an arbitrary function to pairwise combinations of rows or columns.

### theme_trueMinimal, theme_plotly
Clean up your ggplot or plotly visualizations.

### update_github_pkgs
Guess.


## Addins

### insertImgCenterAddin 
For R Markdown files, inserts `<img ...>` with centered options filled in.

### insertSpanAddin 
For R Markdown files, inserts `<span class=''>`.
